A
select goals_id from GOALS where beauty < 0.9 AND beauty > 0.1

select Distinct player_id
from PLAYER as p
Inner JOIN GOALS as g ON g.player_id = p.player_id as pg
where pg.team = "FCB"

select player_id
from (select player_id from PLAYER as p where team = FCB and market_value < 8.0) as pp
inner JOIN GOALS as g ON g.player_id = pp.player_id
group by pg.player_id
having count(pg.player_id) >= 10

didn't understand the request

select avg(pg.beauty)
from PLAYER as p
inner JOIN Goals as g
on p.player_id = g.player_id as pg
where pg.team = psg



B
i didn't understood the question because do you want to have
the couple (player_id, goalid) where the player_is is not
redundant so we have to use Distinct near player_id declaration
so we can have only 1 occuenrence of playerId

select B.goals_id, Distinct A.player_id
from PLAYERS as A, GOALS as B
where A.player_id = B.player_id

C
select Count(*), team
from PLayers as p
left join Goals as g
on p.player_id = g.player_id
where g.player_id IS NULL
group by team
